                 Hi there, may name is Maria Teresa and I come from Nicaragua<br>
                 I moved to Swedeen five years ago and I live in  Helsingborg with my 
                 sambo and my son. As a person I am shy and privat but at the  same time 
                 friendly. I love details and hard working. If I should choose a frase to 
                 describe myself that would be "I don`t give up"!.

             Within my interes are learning languages and I particulary consider it as one of the best
             barrier breaker between people.Traveling and be able  to experience new cultures and 
             environments is also another great interes for me. Nevertheles reading a good book that 
             allow me to fly inmagination and keep my curiosity and focus on the top.

                One of the thing I most enjoy in life is dancing because is great way to express happines 
                or even get rid of bad feeling. I also enjoy a lot  been in contact with nature, 
                can be exploring the sounds of the forest or taking  walks over the beach. However the 
                biggest joy of my life is spending time with my beautiful lite family.
